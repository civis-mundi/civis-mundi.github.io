<h1 class="content-story-section-header">Foreign Credit and Open Banking</h1>

<h2>What did we set out to do?</h2>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        We set out to discover the reasons why personal foreign credit history is not portable --
        and then to see if we could do something to help provide a solution to the problem.
        Our hypothesis has been that it might be a problem of data access.
        We are partly correct.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>What have we accomplished?</h2>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <ul>
        <li>We gathered and documented a good deal of market research.</li>
        <li>We made useful contacts in the industry (at both lenders and AISPs)
            and engaged in discovery interviews.
        </li>
        <li>We created Kotlin Spring Boot starter libraries for integrating
            with key Account Information Service Providers,
            such as Plaid and Tink.
        </li>
        <li>We navigated the authentication and consent idiosyncrasies of each AISP.</li>
        <li>We studied and normalized the various non-standardized AISP schemas into our own canonical
            (incl. accounts, institutions, transactions, payment history, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>We provided a GraphQL API to our integration and normalization layer.</li>
        <li>We created a React Material-UI frontend in which to present normalized data.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>What have we learned?</h2>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        The promise of seamless integration (under the banner of "Open Banking")
        is a project that is not accomplished yet, but it is something that many industry participants,
        both big and small, are scrambling to address now.
        It's been mildly shocking to discover that the financial industry has procrastinated for so long,
        considering the world is entering its third decade of rapid "digital transformation".
        Hence why banks have been so easily disrupted by AISP entrants like Plaid.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this points to the "whys" of the problem.
        It basically comes down to vested interests.
        On the one hand, the big credit bureaus have provided a sufficient clearing-house solution --
        sufficient in the sense that to date the industry hasn't seen any need to disrupt it.
        On the other, financial institutions have assumed they had perpetual ownership over the data provided to them by their
        customers -- but government intervention on behalf of consumer interests is forcing change.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be sure, nobody is sitting still any longer.
        There are many resources being thrown into realizing Open Banking -style integrations, and timetables are
        aggressive.
        We can expect to see significant progress during the next few years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other learnings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's no surprise that the problem of data portability is as much jurisdictional (and even geo-market driven)
            as technical. In fact, the technical challenges are easiest to solve.
        </li>
        <li>From the number of credit card advertisements with which we are inundated, we all know that
            the credit industry has a prepared path for subsuming immigrants into the domestic market.
            It may be temporarily inconvenient and frustrating for the immigrant,
            but in a greater statistical sense, it's a brief window.
            Lenders are more than willing to cycle potential customers through this phase.
            This slice of market is not only small -- it's temporary -- and there is a constant flow of fresh graduates
            into the normalized mainstream.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's an interesting time. Governments (e.g. PSD2) and disruptors (e.g. Plaid)
        have woken the financial industry from its slumber on the topics of transparency and integration.
        As a result of these pressures, we know that both credit bureaus and banks
        are aggressively working on solutions now, closing the doors on certain kinds of disruption.
        Whether they apply their new facilities to the problem of foreign credit portability
        shall be less a question of technical feasibility and more of perceived market opportunity.
