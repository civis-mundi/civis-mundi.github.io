<h1>If you're here from YC ...</h1>

We included a link to this page in our Sep 2021 application.
Since the demo isn't ready yet, our choice was this or nothing.
Work is in progress and we hope you'll check back.
Our goal remains Autumn 2021.

<h1>Architecture</h1>

<p>
In a nutshell:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most Account Information Service Providers have REST (not GraphQL) APIs.
        We convert their output to flow through our systems as schema-based GraphQL JSON.</li>
    <li>Flow modules (a flavor of microservices) collaborate in the backend to perform integration, normalization, aggregation, and analysis tasks.
    These modules are managed by Spring Cloud Data Flow, itself running on Kubernetes in the Google Cloud.
    </li>
    <li>We use the Netflix Domain Graph Service (DGS) to expose backend data to the frontend user interface,
    where the Apollo client is used in place of e.g. Redux to serve data into React components.
    Capacitor is used to create a mobile client.</li>
    <li>OAuth2 (specifically Open ID) are the standard method of authenticating on both front and back-end.</li>
</ul>
