        We enable lending businesses to work with new immigrants immediately
        by incorporating foreign credit history -- calculated in near real-time -- into the risk assessment process.

    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">For Lenders</h1>
    <p>
        With consumer consent, the <b>ifinn</b> platform can
        provide recent immigrants with a credit score calculated
        based on their credit history from abroad.
        Lending businesses in can access this data and incorporate in their loan
        decision-making process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our long-term goal is to present a unified financial history to both lenders and consumers, regardless of
        borders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lenders will of course have both UI and API (GraphQL) access to the platform.
    </p>
    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">For Consumers</h1>
    <p>
        We'd be violating the spirit of PSD2 if we only provided transparency to lenders,
        since point of PSD2 is to provide both consumers and lenders equal footing
        with respect to financial analysis decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>ifinn</b> platform provides a toolset to
        individual consumers so that they can have greater transparency into their own financial data,
        including credit rating. The app allows a consumer to obtain their account data from various
        financial institutions, bring it all into the same "workspace", and obtain summary insights.

    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">Aggregate</h1>
    <p>
        The first step, of course, is to obtain financial data.
        We attach to Account Information Service Providers (ASIPs) to obtain
        financial data from various regions.
        With a consumer's consent, we can access data from banks in their place of origin.
        We bring that data into a virtual workspace where input from all regions is treated equally.
    </p>
    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">Normalize</h1>
    <p>
        Data schemas are disparate, even among Open Banking providers.
        Normalization is the process of transforming all data into a "level playing field"
        in order to apply commensurate analytics.
        This is a long-standing integration problem with which we have much experience.
    </p>
    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">Analyze</h1>
    <p>
        We apply algorithms to the data in order to bring key criteria related to a person's credit-worthiness to the
        forefront.
        We start with Payment History analysis, as payment behavior is the key ingredient
        in most analyses of credit-worthiness.
    </p>
    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">Score</h1>
    <p>
        We summarize the outcomes of our analytics in order to present them for easy consumption by both consumers and
        lenders.
    </p>
    <h1 class="content-story-section-header">Blend</h1>
    <p>
        We expect that our output is one ingredient among several informing an overall analysis.
        Our results augment overall analysis.
        We do not expect our results to be solely responsible for the outcome of any lending decision.
        Rather, our data improves the overall outcome, for both lender and consumer.
