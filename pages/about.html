<h2>Dmitrii Belousov</h2>

<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        Dmitrii is an experienced software engineer who moved to the United States back in 2019. Shortly after arriving,
        his family needed a $10,000 loan to pay for a university summer program for their daughter. He visited dozens of
        lending institutions, but none were willing to issue a loan because he did not have a domestic credit score.
        Dmitrii had years of credit history back in Russia - but it was completely ignored. He had to start from
        scratch. Eventually, Dmitrii managed to get a loan from an online lending company, subject to an upfront fee and
        a high interest rate.
        <p>
    </p>
        A year later, Dmitrii finally accumulated a domestic credit score and got access to common
        credit products. As you can imagine, he endured a frustrating and stressful period
        -- but it inspired him to try to fix the problem.

<h1 class="content-story-section-header">Civis Mundi</h1>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        The Latin words, "civis mundi", mean "citizen of the world". Given our goals, this choice of name seems
        appropriate.
        According to scholars of Latin, the word "civis" is pronounced with a hard "c" and a soft "v" (/ˈkiːʋis/).
