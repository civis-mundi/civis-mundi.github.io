<h2>Dmitrii Belousov</h2>

<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        Dmitrii is an experienced software engineer who moved to the United States back in 2019. Shortly after arriving,
        his family needed a $10,000 loan to pay for university summer program for their daughter.
        Dmitrii visited dozens of lending institutions, but neither was willing to issue a loan, because he did not have
        a local credit score. He had years of credit history back in Russia - but it was completely discarded. He had to start from
        scratch. Eventually, Dmitrii managed to get a loan from online lending company subject to 10% upfront fee and
        extremely high interest rate. Only a year later, he finally acquired credit score and got access to
        common credit products.

<h1 class="content-story-section-header">Civis Mundi</h1>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        The Latin words, "civis mundi", mean "citizen of the world". Given our goals, this choice of name seems
        appropriate.
        According to scholars of Latin, the word "civis" is pronounced with a hard "c" and a soft "v" (/ˈkiːʋis/).
