<h2>Dmitrii Belousov</h2>

<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        Dmitrii moved to the United States in 2019. Upon arrival, he
        realized that he could not access the majority of credit products because he did not have local credit score.
        The only
        ones he could access offered upfront fees and really high interest rates. Despite having an extensive credit
        history back
        in Russia, Dmitrii could not use it to get a local credit score in the US, and he had to wait for over a year to
        finally get
        it.

        Dmitrii is a software engineer ...

<h1 class="content-story-section-header">Civis Mundi</h1>
<div class="content-story-section">
    <p>
        The Latin words, "civis mundi", mean "citizen of the world". Given our goals, this choice of name seems
        appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to scholars of Latin, the word "civis" is pronounced with a hard "c" and a soft "v" (/ˈkiːʋis/).
