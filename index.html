        More than 1 million immigrants arrive in the U.S. each year.

        Without domestic credit history, a recent immigrant is not allowed access to domestic credit products.

        <!-- I added "from scratch" because that IS unfair. -->
        They are expected to start over.
        <i>Even</i> when they might have a perfectly good financial history abroad.

        Hi, my name is Dmitrii. I am a software engineer, and I moved to the United States back in 2019. Upon arrival, I
        realized that I could not access the majority of credit products because I did not have local credit score. The only
        ones I could access offered upfront fees and really high interest rates. Despite having an extensive credit history back
        in Russia, I could not use it to get a local credit score in the US, and I had to wait for over a year to finally get
        it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2015 European Union adopted the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to facilitate competition and encourage non-banks
        to participate in the payments industry -- and ultimately to create a more integrated European payments market. This had
        practical implications beyond the borders of Europe -- world-wide, in fact, including North America. This spurred the
        development of the Open Banking initiative, which includes open APIs to provide more transparency into personal
        financial data (with managed consent, of course).
    </p>
    <p>
        The emergence of Open Banking created an "economy of scale" effect which we can leverage to solve the portable
        financial history problem. We mean that, instead of integrating with each bank, we can now access data from many banks
        in an entire region (e.g. Europe) via open banking data facilitators, like Plaid, Tink, and Brankas. But furthermore we
        can see that even those services are balkanized and de-normalized, so that here is a higher-level opportunity.

    </p>
    <p>
        We are solving the problem of credit score portability. For example, in the United States it takes an immigrant 1+ year
        to access the credit products that people with local credit score have access to. Most immigrants have credit histories
        abroad which are not taken into account by lenders in the United States at all. It is untenable in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we provide recent Europe -> United States immigrants with a credit score calculated
        based on their credit history from Europe, which lending businesses in the US can access and incorporate in their loan
        decision-making process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our long-term goal is to allow a person who is immigrating to a different country to take their domestic credit history
        with them and be able to use it to access credit products in a country they are moving to -- or rather, to make it so
        any person has a unified credit history regardless of borders.
