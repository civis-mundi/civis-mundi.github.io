        We enable lending businesses to work with new immigrants immediately
        by incorporating foreign credit history -- calculated in near real-time -- into the risk assessment process.

        This page follows up on our conceptual introduction (our home page) with
        a more tangible, pseudo-semi-technical explanation.

        PROVIDE A PRODUCT SCREENSHOT HERE. MAY BE MOCKED. HIGHLIGHT "PAYMENT HISTORY" ANALYSIS.
        SHOW A DESKTOP VIEW, SINCE "REAL HARD ANALYTICS" IS OUR SALES PITCH. (HOWEVER, WE SHOULD ALSO
        SHOW A MOBILE SCREEN TO THE SIDE. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE LEGIBLE. IT ONLY NEEDS TO INFORM
        THE VIEWER THAT WE AREN'T IGNORING MOBILE.)

        In the spirit of the <b>Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</b>, this app provides a toolset to
        individual consumers so that they can have greater transparency into their own financial data,
        including credit rating. This app allows a consumer to obtain their account data from various
        financial institutions, bring it all into the same "workspace", and obtain summary insights.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the longer term, this app can provide consumer-friendly business-to-business value. For instance,
        this platform could provide cross-border credit ratings to banks considering loans.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'd be violating the spirit of PSD2 if we _only_ provided transparency to lenders.
        The point of PSD2 is to provide both consumers and lenders equal (where appropriate) transparency
        into financial analysis decisions.
    </p>
    <h2>aggregate</h2>
    <p>
        The first step, of course, is to obtain financial data.
        We attach to Open Banking providers to obtain (with consent)
        financial data pertaining to a particular person.
        We bring that data into a virtual workspace where input from all regions is treated equally.
    </p>
    <h2>normalize</h2>
    <p>
        Data schemas are disparate, even among Open Banking providers.
        Normalization is the process of transforming all data into a "level playing field"
        in order to apply commensurate analytics.
    </p>
    <h2>analyze</h2>
    <p>
        We apply algorithms to the data in order to bring key criteria related to a person's credit-worthiness to the forefront.
    </p>
    <h2>score</h2>
    <p>
        We summarize the outcomes of our analytics in order to present them for easy consumption by both consumers and lenders.
    </p>
    <h2>blend (aka augment)</h2>
    <p>
        We understand that our output is one informing ingredient among several in an overall analysis.
        We expect our output to augment overall analysis.
        There is no sense in which our output is expected to be responsible solely for the outcome of a lending decision.
