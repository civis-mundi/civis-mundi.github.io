        In the spirit of the <b>Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</b>, this app provides a toolset to
        individual consumers so that they can have greater transparency into their own financial data,
        including credit rating. This app allows a consumer to obtain their account data from various
        financial institutions, bring it all into the same "workspace", and obtain summary insights.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the longer term, this app can provide consumer-friendly business-to-business value. For instance,
        this platform could provide cross-border credit ratings to banks considering loans.
